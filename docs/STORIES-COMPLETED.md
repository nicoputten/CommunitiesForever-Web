# Done stories

### WEB-01 Repo skeleton and CI
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript strict, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Playwright, per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` Stack and Layering.
- ESLint forbids imports from `src/server`, `src/app`, `src/components`, React and Node built-ins inside `src/core`.
- Scripts: `npm run dev`, `lint`, `test`, `test:e2e`, `build`. CLAUDE.md "Commands" filled in.
- GitHub Actions on PRs and `develop`: lint, test, build.
- `CHANGELOG.md` with `## Unreleased`, `.env.example`, `README.md` with local setup.
- Done when: a placeholder page renders, one core unit test and one Playwright smoke test pass in CI.

### WEB-03 SavedVariables parser (core)
- `parseLua(text)`: parses a SavedVariables file (`Name = { ... }` assignments, also the fixtures' `return { ... }`) into plain JS values. Supports what the game writes: tables with `["key"] =` and `[n] =` keys, array parts, strings with escapes, numbers (incl. negative, float, exponent), booleans, nil, `--` comments.
- Never executes anything. Limits: 5 MB file, depth 32, clear errors with line and column.
- Copy the addon's fixtures to `tests/fixtures/addon/v0.3`, `v0.4` (unchanged) and a real file from Nico (wrapped as the game writes it, anonymized).
- Unit tests: every construct above, errors, limits, all fixtures parse.
- Done: `src/core/lua.ts` (`parseLua`), fixtures in `tests/fixtures/addon/` and `tests/fixtures/real/beta-2026-10.lua`, tests in `tests/unit/lua*.test.ts`.
