# Backlog

Open stories only, in build order. Done stories move to `docs/STORIES-COMPLETED.md`.
Each story: criteria are testable. "Manual" items are steps only Nico can do; they go in the PR.

Build order: WEB-06, WEB-15, WEB-30, WEB-16, WEB-07, then the screens WEB-17..29 in number order, then the uploader's server side WEB-33, WEB-34, WEB-35. WEB-12 was replaced by WEB-33..35 and the uploader repo (2026-10-27).
WEB-08..11 (the first rough view stories) were replaced by WEB-15..29 after the design workshop.

## Every UI story
- Build the screen in our Next.js app with the tokens from `src/styles/tokens.css` and real data through the view models. The board in `design/boards/` is a **visual reference only**: match its spacing, type and colours, never copy its markup or runtime.
- Always the design system (CLAUDE.md rules 11 and 12): no raw values outside the tokens, design system components first. A deviation only after Nico said so, recorded in `docs/DESIGN.md` "Deviations".
- The screen gets its design checks (WEB-30): computed-style checks for its key elements, accessibility scan, screenshot baselines at desktop and phone size.
- Accessible: semantic HTML, visible focus states, keyboard use, 44 px touch targets, contrast as in `docs/DESIGN.md`, `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured.
- Works at 375 px (phone) and 1440 px (desktop canvas); page max-width 1280.
- Empty, loading and error states of the screen are part of the story.
- Playwright test for the main flow at desktop and phone size; screenshots of both in the PR next to the board.

## E3 Access and hosting

## E4 Design foundations

## E5 Screens

### WEB-28 Phone map
- Boards: `phone-map`, `phone-character`, `phone-roll-call`. Bottom sheet with `vaul`: peek → half → full.
- Peek: the first roll call rows; edge hint "4 in Kalimdor". Tapping a marker zooms in and opens the character half sheet (level, seen, player, item level, role, spec, talents, professions, "Open character", next character in the zone). The full sheet is the roll call with its filters.
- Bug (found in WEB-27, Nico 2026-10-27): on a phone, `?continent=eastern-kingdoms` frames the continent and springs back to the whole world about 120 ms later, because at 1× the map centres the land (WEB-26). A continent on a phone stays framed; the design check's `map-continent-phone` baseline (temporarily the 2× view over the Maelstrom) shows the continent again.

## E6 Later

### WEB-33 Uploader API
- Goal: the server side of the Windows uploader (repo `CommunitiesForever-Upload`), as `docs/UPLOADER-API.md` describes. Finalise that contract in this story (it is a draft) and keep it in sync.
- Pairing: start (device name, app version), short user code without look-alike characters, 10-minute expiry, poll (pending, approved with the token once, denied, expired), rate limit per IP.
- Upload tokens: one per device, upload-only, long random secret stored hashed; created by pairing approval or by hand; revoked by the user, by the app ("Disconnect") or when the user is blocked. A new Drizzle migration (forward-only, rule 5).
- `POST /api/uploader/v1/uploads` with a Bearer token, raw bytes: the same checks and storage as manual uploads (WEB-06, WEB-19), plus `summaryLine`, `highlights`, `counts` and `reportUrl` for the app (from the WEB-14/20 report view models). `401 token_revoked`, `403 may_not_upload`, `413`, `429`.
- `GET` and `DELETE /api/uploader/v1/me`.
- Uploads made with a token record which device sent them (history line "via DESKTOP-NICO").
- Tests: unit tests for codes, tokens and hashing; route tests for every status code; a contract test that checks responses against `docs/UPLOADER-API.md` examples.
- The uploader repo builds against this; changes to the contract are additive (new optional fields) once v1 is released.

### WEB-34 Uploader page
- Board `uploader-page` (copied from the uploader repo). Page `/uploader` for everyone who may upload.
- Intro, "Download for Windows" (WEB-35) with version and size, the three steps, "Your uploaders" (device, connected, last upload, active, Revoke), "Create a token by hand" (shown once, copy button), the note that uploader uploads count like manual ones.
- Pairing approval: with `?code=` the page shows "Connect an uploader?" with the device name and code, Allow / Deny; a wrong or expired code says so.
- Top bar: "Upload" becomes "Uploader". The manual upload page stays and is reached by a small "Upload manually" link on the uploader page (decided with Nico).
- Every UI story criteria, design checks.

### WEB-35 Installer hosting and update feed
- The repos are private, so the site hosts the uploader: `/uploader/download` (signed-in users) and the Velopack update feed for the app (Bearer token), from a folder on the data volume (`/data/uploader`).
- `POST /api/uploader/v1/releases` with a deploy secret (env var), used by the uploader repo's release workflow to publish a new version (installer, packages, feed files). Only the newest few versions are kept.
- Tests for access (no download without sign-in, no feed without a valid token, no publish without the secret).
- Manual: set the deploy secret in the TrueNAS app config and as a GitHub secret in the uploader repo.

### WEB-32 Known bugs
- **On hold** until Nico has tested everything (decided 2026-10-27).
One story for the known bugs, fixed together (Nico, 2026-10-27). Add each one here with where it shows; each fix gets a test.
- **Phone map: the endless sea stops.** On a phone the map frame is only as tall as the land (WEB-25/26), so the sea ends under it and the plain page shows below; the sea does not run on around the world as it does on desktop (WEB-25 "endless sea"). Seen in `tests/design/__screenshots__/map.spec.ts/map-phone.png`. Check against WEB-28 (full-screen phone map), which may change the frame.

### Backlog (unordered, not yet stories)
- Recipe search, once addon CF-38 ships ("who can craft Bolt of Silk Cloth?").
- Activity feed (level ups, profession gains, dungeon runs per day).
- Dungeons: who has which dungeon quests.
- Final emblem and logo for the site.
